Currently an undergrad at the University of Kansas in Computer Science, I am a software engineer that is obsessed with numbers. If you could stick me in a room with a bunch of numbers and a computer, I would feed on beautiful regression models. At the moment, I am a part of Theia, a senior design group building a next gen eye tracking computer interface for people with disabilities. I like to spend my time watch TV and film that I find artistic and reading books that don't pertain to computing.
