I got my Bachelor of Science in Computer Science at the University of Kansas. Currently, I am a software engineer in Kansas City working for Cerner and Caliber Contracting. I spend most of my free time reading fiction, engaging in some musical experience, or wandering around the Crossroads, Westside, or the West Bottoms on foot. Shoot me an email if you're interested in me or what I do.
