Bachelor of Science in Computer Science at the University of Kansas; working at Cerner Corp. in KCMO as a software engineer on the Enterprise Analytics team. I spend most of my free time reading fiction, engaging in some musical experience, watching films and TV, or wandering around the Crossroads, Westside, or the West Bottoms on foot.
